# Design-Pattern
This Design Pattern is one of the Software Engineering module in Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation.

The module is to apply the design pattern from Gang of Four design pattern to the solution (Simpler solution) to make the design of the software to have a better performance. The attached file has two, DPATSS and DPATRS. DPATSS refers to simpler solution whereas DPATRS refers to refined solution.

Simpler solutions means the solution is with anti-pattern.
Refined solution means the solution is with design pattern.

The refined solution has applied three design patterns, they are Singleton, Decorator, and Factory.

Both solutions are about the Pizza Vendor Machine scenario.
After uploading to the SonarQube, the refined solution got a better performance compared to the simpler solution, in terms of maintainability, availability, code smell and so on.
